Increased in: Deficiency of any individual coagulation factor except Factors XIII and VII, presence of nonspecific inhibitor (eg, lupus anticoagulant), specific factor inhibitor (von Willebrand disease, heparin, direct thrombin inhibitor, hemophilia A and B, DIC). Decreased in: Hypercoagulable states.",
